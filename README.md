# highly-divisible-triangular-number 
A way of finding the first triangular number with over 500 integer factors

This project was completed for the [Project Euler - Problem 12](https://projecteuler.net/problem=12).

I recommend that this code should only be viewed _after_ you've completed your own implementation.  
If you're super stuck, take a break, take a walk, and it will come to you; good luck.
